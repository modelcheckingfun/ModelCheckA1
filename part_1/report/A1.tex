\subsection{A1.1}

\subsubsection{a}

For all paths, it should always hold on every step of the path,
if the client is active it should have its job somewhere in the queue.

\begin{verbatim}
P>=1 [ G ((state1=1) => (job1=1|job2=1)) ]
P>=1 [ G ((state2=1) => (job1=2|job2=2)) ]
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{b}

The properties hold according to PRISM.

\subsubsection{c}

The queue for the SRT scheduler is different.
"job1" being true means that a job for
client 1 is in the queue,
while "job2" being true means that a job for
client 2 is in the queue.

When client 1 is active,
it means that "state1" is true.
Since we require that when a client is active,
its job is in the scheduler's queue,
that means that "state1" implies "job1"
everywhere, or in other words, for all paths
always, "state1" implies "job1".
Repeat for client 2.

\begin{verbatim}
P>=1 [ G ((state1=1) => job1) ]
P>=1 [ G ((state2=1) => job2) ]
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{d}

The properties hold according to PRISM.

\subsection{A1.4}

\subsubsection{a}

$\Phi$ holding for a transition system means that $\Phi$ holds
in all initial states.

$AG \Phi$ holding for a transition system means that $\Phi$ holds
for all states reachable from the initial states.

\subsubsection{b}

In PRISM 4.0.*, a property is verified for all the initial states.
meaning that the meanings of $\Phi$ and $AG \Phi$ are different

\subsubsection{c}

Give $s$ an atomic proposition with a unique name,
maybe $initialstate$, and then define $\Phi '$ thus:

$initialstate \implies \Phi$

This will ensure that $\Phi$ is only checked for $s$,
despite checking $\Phi '$ for all states.

\subsubsection{d}

Define $\Phi '$ thus:

$AG \Phi$
