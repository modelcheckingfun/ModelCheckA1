\subsection{A2.1}

\subsubsection{a}

$S = \{s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3\}$

$\rightarrow = \{
  (s_0, s_1), (s_0, s_2),
  (s_1, s_1),
  (s_2, s_2), (s_2, s_3),
  (s_3, s_3)
\}$

$S_0 = \{s_0\}$

$AP = \{\Phi_1, \Phi_2\}$

$L = \{
  (s_0, \{\Phi_1\}),
  (s_1, \{\Phi_2\}),
  (s_2, \{\}),
  (s_3, \{\Phi_1, \Phi_2\})
\}$

\subsubsection{b}

i.: "For all paths, $\Phi_2$ eventually holds". False, since $\Phi_2$ never holds on the path $s_0{s_2}^w$.

ii.: "For all paths, $\Phi_2$ holds in the next state". False, since $\Phi_2$ does not hold
     in the second state of the initial path fragment $s_0s_2$.

iii.: "For at least one path, $\Phi_1$ eventually holds". True, since $\Phi_1$ holds in $s_0$.

iv.: "For all paths, $\Phi_1$ holds until $\Phi_2$". False, since $\Phi_2$ never holds on the path $s_0{s_2}^w$.

\subsection{A2.4}

See appendix "A2.4".

The claims regarding the properties were verified to be correct.
